\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of \code{\link[base]{class}} 'ardl' or 'uecm'.}

\item{case}{An integer from 1-5 or a character string specifying whether the
'intercept' and/or the 'trend' have to participate in the short-run or the
long-run relationship (cointegrating equation) (see section 'Cases' below).}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the significance
level of the critical value bounds. If \code{NULL} (default), no critical
value bounds for a specific level of significance are provide, only the
p-value. See section 'alpha, bounds and p-value' below for details.}

\item{pvalue}{A logical indicating whether you want the p-value to be
provided. The default is \code{TRUE}. See section 'alpha, bounds and
p-value' below for details.}

\item{exact}{A logical indicating whether you want asymptotic (T = 1000) or
exact sample size critical value bounds and p-value. The default is
\code{FALSE} for asymptotic. See section 'alpha, bounds and p-value' below
for details.}

\item{R}{An integer indicating how many iterations will be used if
\code{exact = TRUE}. Default is 40000.}

\item{test}{A character vector indicating whether you want the Wald test to
be expressed as 'F' or as 'Chisq' statistic. Default is "F".}

\item{vcov_matrix}{The estimated covariance matrix of the random variable
that the test uses to estimate the test statistic. The default is
\code{vcov(object)} (when \code{vcov_matrix = NULL}), but other estimations
of the covariance matrix of the regression's estimated coefficients can
also be used (e.g., using \code{\link[sandwich]{vcovHC}} or
\code{\link[sandwich]{vcovHAC}}). Only applicable if the input object is of
class "uecm".}
}
\value{
A list with class "htest" containing the following components:
  \item{\code{method}}{a character string indicating what type of test was
     performed.}
  \item{\code{alternative}}{a character string describing the alternative
     hypothesis.}
  \item{\code{statistic}}{the value of the test statistic.}
  \item{\code{null.value}}{the value of the population parameters \code{k}
     (the number of independent variables) and \code{T} (the number of
     observations) specified by the null hypothesis.}
  \item{\code{data.name}}{a character string giving the name(s) of the data.}
  \item{\code{parameters}}{numeric vector containing the critical value
     bounds.}
  \item{\code{p.value}}{the p-value of the test.}
  \item{\code{PSS2001parameters}}{numeric vector containing the critical

     bounds, the alpha level of significance and the p-value.}
}
\description{
\code{bounds_f_test} performs the Wald bounds-test for no cointegration
\cite{Pesaran et al. (2001)}. It is a Wald test on the parameters of a UECM
(Unrestricted Error Correction Model) expressed either as a Chisq-statistic
or as an F-statistic.

\section{alpha, bounds and p-value}{
 In this section it is explained how the
  critical value bounds and p-values are obtained.
  \itemize{
     \item If \code{exact = FALSE}, then the asymptotic (T = 1000) critical
         value bounds and p-value are provided.
     \item Only the asymptotic critical value bounds and p-values, and only
         for k <= 10 are precalculated, everything else has to be computed.
     \item Precalculated critical value bounds and p-values were simulated
         using \code{set.seed(2020)} and \code{R = 70000}.
     \item Precalculated critical value bounds exist only for \code{alpha}
         being one of the 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.15 or 0.2,
         everything else has to be computed.
     \item If \code{alpha} is one of the 0.1, 0.05, 0.025 or 0.01 (and
         \code{exact = FALSE} and k <= 10), \code{PSS2001parameters} shows
         the critical value bounds presented in \cite{Pesaran et al. (2001)}
         (less precise).
  }
}

\section{Cases}{
 According to \cite{Pesaran et al. (2001)}, we distinguish the
long-run relationship (cointegrating equation) (and thus the bounds-test and
the Restricted ECMs) between 5 different cases. These differ in terms of
whether the 'intercept' and/or the 'trend' are restricted to participate in
the long-run relationship or they are unrestricted and so they participate in
the short-run relationship.

\describe{
  \item{Case 1:}{\itemize{
    \item No \emph{intercept} and no \emph{trend}.
    \item \code{case} inputs: 1 or "n" where "n" stands for none.}}
  \item{Case 2:}{\itemize{
    \item Restricted \emph{intercept} and no \emph{trend}.
    \item \code{case} inputs: 2 or "rc" where "rc" stands for restricted
     constant.}}
  \item{Case 3:}{\itemize{
    \item Unrestricted \emph{intercept} and no \emph{trend}.
    \item \code{case} inputs: 3 or "uc" where "uc" stands for unrestricted
    constant.}}
  \item{Case 4:}{\itemize{
    \item Unrestricted \emph{intercept} and restricted \emph{trend}.
    \item \code{case} inputs: 4 or "ucrt" where "ucrt" stands for
    unrestricted constant and restricted trend.}}
  \item{Case 5:}{\itemize{
    \item Unrestricted \emph{intercept} and unrestricted \emph{trend}.
    \item \code{case} inputs: 5 or "ucut" where "ucut" stands for
     unrestricted constant and unrestricted trend.}}
}

Note that you can't restrict (or leave unrestricted) a parameter that doesn't
exist in the input model. For example, you can't compute \code{recm(object,
case=3)} if the object is an ARDL (or UECM) model with no intercept. The same
way, you can't compute \code{bounds_f_test(object, case=5)} if the object is
an ARDL (or UECM) model with no linear trend.

\examples{
data(denmark)

## How to use cases under different models (regarding deterministic terms)

## Construct an ARDL(3,1,3,2) model with different deterministic terms -

# Without constant
ardl_3132_n <- ardl(LRM ~ LRY + IBO + IDE -1, data = denmark, order = c(3,1,3,2))

# With constant
ardl_3132_c <- ardl(LRM ~ LRY + IBO + IDE, data = denmark, order = c(3,1,3,2))

# With constant and trend
ardl_3132_ct <- ardl(LRM ~ LRY + IBO + IDE + trend(LRM), data = denmark, order = c(3,1,3,2))

## F-bounds test for no level relationship (no cointegration) ----------

# For the model without a constant
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_n, case = 1)
# or
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_n, case = "n")

# For the model with a constant
# Including the constant term in the long-run relationship (restricted constant)
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_c, case = 2)
# or
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_c, case = "rc")

# Including the constant term in the short-run relationship (unrestricted constant)
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_c, case = "uc")
# or
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_c, case = 3)

# For the model with constant and trend
# Including the constant term in the short-run and the trend in the long-run relationship
# (unrestricted constant and restricted trend)
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_ct, case = "ucrt")
# or
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_ct, case = 4)

# For the model with constant and trend
# Including the constant term and the trend in the short-run relationship
# (unrestricted constant and unrestricted trend)
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_ct, case = "ucut")
# or
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_ct, case = 5)

## Note that you can't restrict a deterministic term that doesn't exist

# For example, the following tests will produce an error:
\dontrun{
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_c, case = 1)
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_ct, case = 3)
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_c, case = 4)
}

## Asymptotic p-value and critical value bounds (assuming T = 1000) ----

# Include critical value bounds for a certain level of significance

# F-statistic is larger than the I(1) bound (for a=0.05) as expected (p-value < 0.05)
bft <- bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_c, case = 2, alpha = 0.05)
bft
bft$tab

# Traditional but less precise critical value bounds, as presented in Pesaran et al. (2001)
bft$PSS2001parameters

# F-statistic is slightly larger than the I(1) bound (for a=0.005)
# as p-value is slightly smaller than 0.005
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_c, case = 2, alpha = 0.005)

## Exact sample size p-value and critical value bounds -----------------

# Setting a seed is suggested to allow the replication of results
# 'R' can be increased for more accurate resutls

# F-statistic is smaller than the I(1) bound (for a=0.01) as expected (p-value > 0.01)
# Note that the exact sample p-value (0.01285) is very different than the asymptotic (0.004418)
# It can take more than 30 seconds
\dontrun{
set.seed(2020)
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_c, case = 2, alpha = 0.01, exact = TRUE)
}

## "F" and "Chisq" statistics ------------------------------------------

# The p-value is the same, the test-statistic and critical value bounds are different but analogous
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_c, case = 2, alpha = 0.01)
bounds_f_test(ardl_3132_c, case = 2, alpha = 0.01, test = "Chisq")
