Title: ARDL, ECM and Bounds-Test for Cointegration
Description: Creates complex autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models
    providing just the order and automatically constructs the underlying
    unrestricted and restricted error correction model (ECM). It also performs
    the bounds-test for cointegration as described in Pesaran et al. (2001) <doi:10.1002/jae.616> and provides the multipliers and the cointegrating
    equation.
